        "### Modelling folds using structural geology\n\nThe following section will describe how the fold axis, fold axial\nsurface and fold vergence can be used to help constrain the shape of the\nfolded surface. To do this we need to build a fold frame which is\ncurvilinear coordinate system based around the fold axis and the fold\naxial surface.\n\nThere are three coordinates to the fold frame: \\* coordinate 0 is the\naxial surface of the fold and is parallel to the axial foliation \\*\ncoordinate 1 is the fold axis direction field and is orthogonal to the\naxial foliation \\* coordinate 2 is orthogonal to both the fold axis\ndirection field and axial foliation and is roughly parallel to the\nextension direction of the fold\n\nThree direction vectors are defined by the normalised gradient of these\nfields: \\* $e_0$ - red \\* $e_1$ - green \\* $e_2$ -\nblue\n\nThe orientation of the folded foliation can be defined by rotating\n$e_1$ around $e_0$ by the fold axis rotation angle\n$\\alpha_P$ to give the orientation of the fold axis. The\norientation of the folded foliation can then be defined by rotating the\nplane defined by the fold axis and $e_0$ around the fold axis by\nthe fold limb rotation angle $\\alpha_L$.\n\n### Calculating the fold rotation angles\n\nThe rotation angles can be calculated for observations of the folded\nfoliation and assocaited lineations. For example, the fold axis rotation\nangle is found by calculating the angle between the gradient of the fold\naxis direction field and the intersection lineations shown in A). The\nfold limb rotation angle is found by finding the the angle to rotate the\nfolded foliation to be parallel to the plane of the axial foliation\nshown in B and C.\n\n\n"
