  abstract = {In this paper we introduce a new, precise and adaptive method for the implicit reconstruction of faulted surfaces with complex geometry from scattered, unorganized points as obtained from seismic data or laser scanners. We embed the point set into a 3d-complex on which a 3d-implicit function is interpolated. The 3d-complex is a set of tetrahedrons and the implicit function represents a surface that lies as close as possible to the input data points. The density of the 3d-complex can be adapted to efficiently control both the precision of the implicit function and the size of triangles of the reconstructed surface. Discontinuities in the topology of the tetrahedral mesh make it possible to reconstruct discontinuous, bounded surfaces and very close parallel patches without introducing unwanted connections (topological "handles") between these regions. To compute the implicit function we use the discrete smooth interpolation (DSI) method with a set of boundary, off-boundary and smoothness constraints. The interpolation problem does not primarily depend on the number of input data points but on the magnitude of the 3d-complex. This method can be applied to the construction of faulted horizons and salt-top surfaces. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract  = {The process of building three-dimensional (3D) geological models can be framed as an inverse problem where a model describing the 3D distribution of rock units is non-uniquely derived from geological observations. The inverse problem theory provides a powerful framework for inferring these parameters from all geological observations, in a similar way to how a geologist can iteratively update their structural interpretation while mapping. Existing geological knowledge is usually indirectly incorporated into 3D models using the geologist's non-unique interpretation as form lines, cross sections and level maps. These approaches treat constraints derived from geological knowledge in the same way as direct observations, diluting and confusing both information provided by geological knowledge and hard data resulting in significant subjectivity. We present a geological inversion using Bayesian inference where geological knowledge can be incorporated directly into the interpolation scheme with likelihood functions and informative prior distributions. We demonstrate these approaches on a series of synthetic fold shapes as a proof of concept and a case study from the Proterozoic Davenport Province in the Northern Territory, Australia. The combined inversion of geological data and knowledge significantly reduces the uncertainty in possible fold geometries where data is sparse or highly ambiguous. This could be used by geologists while mapping to propagate information about uncertainties throughout the mapping/model building process and would allow for different structural interpretations to be rapidly tested for targeted data collection.},

@article{Laurent2016,
  abstract  = {© 2016 Elsevier B.V. Three-dimensional structural modeling is gaining importance for a broad range of quantitative geoscientific applications. However, existing approaches are still limited by the type of structural data they are able to use and by their lack of structural meaning. Most techniques heavily rely on spatial data for modeling folded layers, but are unable to completely use cleavage and lineation information for constraining the shape of modeled folds. This lack of structural control is generally compensated by expert knowledge introduced in the form of additional interpretive data such as cross-sections and maps. With this appro ach, folds are explicitly designed by the user instead of being derived from data. This makes the resulting structures subjective and deterministic. This paper introduces a numerical framework for modeling folds and associated foliations from typical field data. In this framework, a parametric description of fold geometry is incorporated into the interpolation algorithm. This way the folded geometry is implicitly derived from observed data, while being controlled through structural parameters such as fold wavelength, amplitude and tightness. A fold coordinate system is used to support the numerical description of fold geometry and to modify the behavior of classical structural interpolators. This fold frame is constructed from fold-related structural elements such as axial foliations, intersection lineations, and vergence. Poly-deformed terranes are progressively modeled by successively modeling each folding event going backward through time. The proposed framework introduces a new modeling paradigm, which enables the building of three-dimensional geological models of complex poly-deformed terranes. It follows a process based on the structural geologist approach and is able to produce geomodels that honor both structural data and geological knowledge.},

  abstract  = {We introduce a new method for implicit structural modeling. The main developments in this paper are the new regularization operators we propose by extending inherent properties of the classic one-dimensional discrete second derivative operator to higher dimensions. The proposed regularization operators discretize naturally on the Cartesian grid using finite differences, owing to the highly symmetric nature of the Cartesian grid. Furthermore, the proposed regularization operators do not require any special treatment on boundary nodes, and their generalization to higher dimensions is straightforward. As a result, the proposed method has the advantage of being simple to implement. Numerical examples show that the proposed method is robust and numerically efficient.},
