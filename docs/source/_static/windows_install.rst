        **Installing a precompiled version**

    LoopStructural can then be installed into your python environment by running the command within your chosen python virtual environment.
    .. code-block::
        pip install LoopStructural

.. container:: toggle

    .. container:: header

        If you want to install LoopStructural from source to be able to modify the code you will need to have a working C++ compiler.
        This is best done using anaconda
