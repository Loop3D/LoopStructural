# Loop3D Structural Modelling Engine
## Overview
The Loop3D Structural Modelling Engine is a geometrical modeling engine for building structural geological models.
It has been developed by Lachlan Grose at Monash University as part of the Loop project.
LP170100985:  Loop - Enabling Stochastic 3D Geological modeling is a OneGeology initiative funded by the Australian Research Council and supported by Monash University, University of Western Australia, Geoscience Australia, the Geological Surveys of Western Australia, Northern Territory, South Australia and New South Wales as well as the Research for Integrative Numerical Geology, Universite de Lorraine, RWTH Aachen, Geological Survey of Canada, British Geological Survey, Bureau de Recherches Geologiques et Minieres and Auscope.

## Time aware geological modeling

###GeologicalModel
A geological model is a collection of geological features which are geometrical elements of a geological model. 
The geological model contains the topological relationships between these different elements.
