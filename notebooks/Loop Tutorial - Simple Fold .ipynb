The fold axis rotation angle ($\\alpha_{p}$) is plotted against the y coordinate,and the fold limb rotation angle ($\\alpha_{L}$) is plotted against the z coordinate. With the S-plot we can characterize the effect of the younger folding event on the geometry of an older structure independtly from overprinting deformational events.  \n",
